# TypeScript boilerplate

Personal boilerplate to work with TypeScript projects on Nodejs.

Includes Express and Axios for easy start on APIs.

Also includes Mocha, Chai, and Sinon for testing. May also include Karma in the future.

Also enforces coding standard with Prettier and ESLint, and also enforces good commit messages with Commitlint.
